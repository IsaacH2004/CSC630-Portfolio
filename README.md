# Welcome to my CSC630 Portfolio! 

Here, you will find a collection of all assignments which I completed for the CSC630 class. 
I'll let the visualizations speak for themselves, and I won't take up too much space with this README, 
but I would like to take a second to reecognize that my time in this class has been exceptionally fun and 
rewarding. Thanks to the support of Dr. Armstrong and my peers, I explored many new methods of data
visualization and had a great time doing so. Thank you all so much for your time-- it's been a plesure.
