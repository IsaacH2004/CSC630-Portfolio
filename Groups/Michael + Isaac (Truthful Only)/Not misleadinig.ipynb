    "The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is the inspection and visualization of two datasets, one featuring factual news articles and another featuring misinformative ones. The subject matter of the datasets varies but generally revolves around ex-president Donald Trump and his shenanigans; all articles that do not contain the world \"Trump\" will be removed from the data before visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important details about the dataset (source: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) that should be discussed prior to any investigation of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Firstly, the dataset is a somewhat-credible source of information. It does not disclose the source of the articles, nor does it mention the criteria used to classify misinformative articles. The dataset's credibility is partially redeemed in that it is held in high regard by the Kaggle community (1000+ upvotes and 46 thousand downloads). \n",
    "\n",
    "> Secondly, almost all of the \"true\" dataset (not misinformative) consists of articles written by Reuters. Independent fact-checkers rate Reuters as \"least biased\" and consider its factual reporting to be \"very high\" (source: https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), but the dataset is likely not wholly representative of news on Donald Trump regardless.

He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar.

It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

       "'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. '"

       "'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. '"

    "In my _authentic_ visualization, I use two separate graphs to display the top ten most common words in a dataset of both truthful and misinformative (untruthful) articles discussing Donald Trump, along with the number of times each word occurs. I believe that the visualization depicts the nuanced nature of misinformation, as there is nothing particular about any of the words included in the visualization that is \"misinformative\" or \"truthful\"; I could switch the labels on the dataset (label the misinformative words as truthful and vice-versa) and my visualization would seem equally as valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Color__\n",
    "> In my visualization, the truthful words are represented in blue and the misinformative / untruthful ones are shown in orange. Blue and orange were the colors that Altair automatically used, and I left them unchanged because I felt that they perfectly illustrated the contrast between truth and misinformation. Blue is a color that represents safety (think: blue sky), while orange alludes to a medium level of danger (not quite as severe as red, but it conveys a sense of looming doom). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Tooltips__\n",
    "> I think that the tooltips, courtesy of Altair, were my favorite detail of this project (hover your mouse over each of the circles in the visualization to see what word is represented and how many times it appears in a dataset). Because some of the words in my dataset appear thousands of times, solely using the radius of each circle in my visualization to represent the # of occurrences would not be very detailed (nobody would be able to tell just from radius exactly how many times a word appears). Further, the idea of putting each word on the x-axis so that each circle in the visualization would have an identity attached felt clunky to me. Using the tooltip was therefore a way for me to display my data conscicely and cleanly. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Place__ \n",
    "> Each circle in the visualization hovers above a number in the x-axis that indicates its rank in the list of most common words for either the truthful or misinformative / untruthful articles (ex. \"Trump\", with rank 1, is the most common word in both misinformative and truthful articles). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Size of Circles__\n",
    "> Simply put, the size of each circle in the visualization indicates the number of times the word it represents occurrs in a dataset; it seemed logical to me that the more common words be represented by a larger mark. However, the tooltips, which give an actual count of each word's occurrences, are a much more conscice representation of word commonness (is that a word???) than circle size.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Legend__\n",
    "> The legend, located towards the right of the visualization, explains my usage of color and size (see above). Although some of the information in the legend can be inferred from the visualization, I thought it important to include the legend just to be thorough and eliminiate any possible viewer confusion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Mistakes__\n",
    "> Unfortunately, I could not figure out (even after hours of scouring the web) how to make the circles in my visualization larger. This is likely a result of the circle sizes being automatically set by Altair based on the number of word occurrences."
